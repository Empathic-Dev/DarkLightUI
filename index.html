      <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time. Resistance is futile.</p></div>

      <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.</p></div>

        <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.</p></div>

    <div class="why">
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Dark Mode is a color scheme designed for low light settings. It's also an accessability tool that helps people with little vision see the content of the website with ease.</p>
      <p>It's not just a cool aesthetic or design fad. A lot of people browse the web at night, including me, so it only seems fair to design Dark Mode alongside the Normal/Light Mode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="how">
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>In CSS, I created a <code>.dark-mode</code> that changes the <code>background-color</code> of the <code>body, article and div's</code> to a dark grey color. It also changes the text <code>color</code> to an off-white color and applies a <code>filter: brightness(80%)</code> to all images.</p>
      <p>In JavaScript, I created a <code>toggleDarkLight()</code> that grabs the <code>body</code> and applies and removes the <code>.dark-mode</code> when the toggle at the top is clicked.</p>
