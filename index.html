      <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time. Resistance is futile.</p></div>

      <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.</p></div>

        <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Lick plastic bags intently sniff hand, curl into a furry donut. Bring your owner a dead bird why must they do that, and small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur. Eats owners hair then claws head. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed cry louder at reflection make meme, make cute face or taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Lick the other cats demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away but meow meow.</p></div>

It's 3am, time to create some chaos snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep so attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently or allways wanting food for paw your face to wake you up in the morning.</p></div>

        <div class="articleExcerpt"><p>Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.</p></div>
